# Unit14-KanbanBoard

## Description

I built a Kanban board application which includes JWT authentication. The app has its login page, which is presented with form inputs for username and password.
If the user is trying to input an invalid username or password, an error message will be displayed. When the user logs in, a JWT will be stored in the client's
local storage. Also, if the user doesn't use the website for a certain period of time, the session will expire.
